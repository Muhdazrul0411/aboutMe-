Hi there! I'm [Azrul Redzuan], a passionate and curious tech enthusiast from Malaysia 🇲🇾. Currently diving deep into the world of automation, databases, and embedded systems, I love building smart solutions that solve real-world problems.

With hands-on experience in:

🔧 Programming PLC (Omron, CX-Programmer)

💡 Building smart home & IoT projects using Raspberry Pi Pico W / NodeMCU

📦 Working with MySQL databases and building queries like a boss

📊 Documenting and presenting technical work in a clear, professional way

I always strive to learn, build, and grow — and I believe projects speak louder than grades. 🔍
